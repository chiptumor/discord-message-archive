# [Discord Message Archive][dma]

This is intended to archive Discord conversations, roleplays, and to create custom conversations for roleplay or example purposes.

**This is not intended to fake conversations or interactions!** Please do not use it for such. If anything goes down revolving this website and usage of it, I do not plan on being held responsible. I made this website mostly with interest in roleplays, but felt it could hold more information.

**You will need to host your images elsewhere!** Uploading images directly isn't supported yet, so use something like [File Garden](<https://filegarden.com>) or [Catbox](<https://catbox.moe>) to get a link to your media files for attachments or profile pictures.

There will be more here when I can think of stuff to write.

For now, this site is in... Alpha, I think? It's not ready in the slightest, and has a good yet to be.
